# BulkOCR
The intent of this project is that you can select either a folder or multiple image files and this code will process each of them, outputting a .txt file.  I am currently a student and still learning and this was a project to help fill a personal need and to practice.

## To Run
In order to run the console application, 
1. Navigate to: Code\BulkOCR\bin\Debug\net8.0 and download this folder.
2. Find the BulkOCR.exe file and run it.

You can alternatively dowload all the code and run it from Visual Studio.

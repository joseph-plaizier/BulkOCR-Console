# BulkOCR
The intent of this project is that you can select either a folder or multiple image files and this code will process each of them, outputting a .txt file locally to the computer you're running the code on (or where you designate).  I am currently a student and still learning and this was a project to help fill a personal need and to practice.


## Branches
There are a number of branches for this project.  The Main branch will house the final executable code for the web application (currently it does not).  The Main-Dev branch will house the executable code for the console (currently it does not).  The dev branch will house working code for the console application.  The web branch will house working code for the web application.
